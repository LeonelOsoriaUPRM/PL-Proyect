# Baby C#
Written for our Programming Languages class

This is an entry level C# IDE meant to be used by people who have little or no experience programing in any language.  
This IDE features a button panel with some of the most frequently used functions with explanations on how they work and how to write them, as well as "fill in the blank" controls to facilitate the coding process while keeping the same syntax used in C# meaning the user should be able to easily transition into a more feature rich IDE without having to re-learn every funtion.

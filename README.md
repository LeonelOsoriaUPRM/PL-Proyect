# Baby C#
Written for our Programming Languages class

**For our professor:**
Some of our commit history is only visible on the master branch, this is due to a change in default branch relatively late in the develoment process.

This is an entry level C# IDE meant to be used by people who have little or no experience programing in any language.  
This IDE features a button panel with some of the most frequently used functions with explanations on how they work and how to write them, as well as "fill in the blank" controls to facilitate the coding process while keeping the same syntax used in C# meaning the user should be able to easily transition into a more feature rich IDE without having to re-learn every function.  

**Features to be added:**

	-A walkthrough tutorial 
	
	-More advanced built-in example programs 
	
	-Possibility of opening .cs files
	
	-Context specific text highlighting like most IDEs

**Features Missing:**
	
	-Variable Array support
